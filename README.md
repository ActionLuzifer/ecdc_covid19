# ecdc_covid19
This is a non-official mirror of the covid19 cases from the ecdc, the "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control".

Original data where from here: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide

My plan is to update this repository on a daily base, as the ecdc updates it daily, too.

Licence: The downloadable data are updated daily and contains the latest available public data on COVID-19. You may use the data in line with ECDC’s copyright policy.
